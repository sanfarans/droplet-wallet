# Droplet Wallet
Droplet Wallet makes micro-donations every time you use it. With thousands of users, these tiny contributions add up to create a big impact. Our goal is to harness the power of micro-transactions to support charities effortlessly as users perform their regular transactions.

## Introduction
Droplet Wallet integrates micro-donations into every transaction you make. By setting a small percentage of each transaction to be donated, users collectively contribute significant funds to charities over time. The wallet is built on the Stellar network, leveraging its fast and low-cost transactions.

## Features
- Micro-Donations: Automatically donate a small percentage of each transaction to a charity of your choice.
- Customizable Donation Fee: Set your preferred donation percentage (default is 1%).
- Charity Selection: Choose any Stellar address as your charity recipient.
- Secure Transactions: Built using Stellar smart contracts for secure and transparent operations.

## How It Works
### Initialization:

Users connect their Stellar wallet to Droplet Wallet.
Initialize the wallet smart contract with your Stellar address.
Set up your preferred charity address and donation fee percentage.

### Funding:

Fund your Droplet Wallet by transferring XLM or other supported tokens.

### Transactions:

When you transfer funds to others, a micro-donation is automatically sent to your chosen charity based on the fee percentage.
Both the recipient and the charity receive their respective amounts transparently.

## Scaling Impact:

As more users utilize Droplet Wallet, these micro-donations accumulate, leading to substantial support for charities.

## Roadmap:

- Finish the frontend PoC.
- Set up deployer contract for wallets.
- Integrate with passkey-kit.
